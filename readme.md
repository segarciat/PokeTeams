# PokeTeams

## Description

Full Stack application which is live at https://poketeams.xyz that allows users to create Pokemon teams. Makes use of the public [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for Pokemon data and the [PokeTeams API](https://poketeams.xyz/api/v1) for user accounts and other things.

## PokeTeams API

The API for this website is located at https://poketeams.xyz/api/v1. It's a private API that I developed by folowing a tutorial on Udemy, but you can see the documentation there.

If you wish to fork this, be sure to rename the `config.env.env` file to `config.env` and populate with the values of your choice.

Once you've done this, run

```
npm install
```

Issue either of the following commands to run the server:

```
# development mode.
npm run dev

# production mode.
npm run start
```

## PokeTeams frontend

Though this started as a simple app written with vanilla JS, I eventually switched to using babel and webpack to continue to develop this application. Should you decide to clone or fork, make note of the following command:

```
# Outputs static files (bundles) to /dist/ folder.
npm run build:prod
```

This project started as a simple frontend mockup on figma with @jm-gonzalez. Together, he and I came up with a simple design that we implemented in Bootstrap. In the time we worked together, we came up with the design, markup, and code for the Pokedex tab, as well as the Moves tab. This wouldn't have been possible without him.

I also want to thank [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy). I followed his tutorial on Udemy to create the nodejs/mongodb backend, where he built the [devcamper API](https://github.com/bradtraversy/devcamper-api). Actually, most of what I know about web development, though not coding in general, can be attributed to watching his videos.

I figured learning about backend development would be easier if I had a project to go along with it, and Brad's tutorial made the process a smooth sailing.
