# PokeTeams

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tests

### Unit Tests

Unit tests have the pattern `*.unit.test.ts` (or `.tsx`) are implemented with Vitest and React Testing Library; see `package.json` and
`vitest.config.ts`. Run them with:

```bash
npm test
```

The starting point for the test setup was the [Next.js testing documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/testing). The tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

The [Testing Library documentation recommends a browser extension](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about#browser-extension) that allows you to inspect elements on your page and provides suggested queries. These can in turn be used to help with UI testing. Find the [Testing Playground extension here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/testing-playground/hejbmebodbijjdhflfknehhcgaklhano)

### Integration Tests

Integration tests also use Vitest, but they correspond to file ending in `integ.test.ts` (or `.tsx`); see `package.json` and `vitest.config.ts`. Moreover, they require using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Create a Docker container:

```bash
# Services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
docker compose up
```

Once the containers/services have initialized, you can run the integration tests with:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

Note that environment variables are loaded from `.env.local.test`, and they contain values from `docker-compose.yml`.

#### Mock API

During tests, API requests to PokeAPI are mocked using the `msw` package; see [MSW - Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/).

### End-To-End Tests

End-to-end tests are implemented with Playwright; see `package.json`. Run them with:

```bash
# See https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests

# Build the app.
npm run build

# Run in headless mode.
npm run test:e2e

# Run interactively in headed mode.
npm run test:e2e -- --headed

# Run interactively in UI mode.
npm run test:e2e -- --ui
```

See [Playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/). Also, see the [basic Next.js Test Playwright setup](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/testing#manual-setup-1).

### Issues

There currently is no clear way to test React Server Components with React Testing Library. See: https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/issues/1209.

## Learn More about Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
