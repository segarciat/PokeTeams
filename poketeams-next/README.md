## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tests

Run tests with

```bash
npm test
```

The starting point for the test setup was the [Next.js testing documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/testing#setting-up-jest-with-the-rust-compiler). The tests use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

The [Testing Library documentation recommends a browser extension](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about#browser-extension) that allows you to inspect elements on your page and provides suggested queries. These can in turn be used to help with UI testing. Find the [Testing Playground extension here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/testing-playground/hejbmebodbijjdhflfknehhcgaklhano)
